## Introduction

**Simple HTTP Server**: is a simple HTTP server implementation in C. The server can respond
GET requests with static folder specified resources.

### Warning
- This implementation has memory leaks and is currently a work in progress, but it works.
- I'm implementing this just for fun, not intendeed to be a really efficient web server.
- I won't provide any support until a stable version has been released.

### Story

This project started as a coding kata for implementing a really simple web server to see
the inner workings of sockets and how the HTTP protocol is implemented.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Add execution permissions to **compile.sh**.
3. Run the script.
4. Enjoy the slow and with leaks web server!

**NOTE**: make sure you have the gcc essential compilation packages installed
