## Introduction

**Simple HTTP Server**: is a simple HTTP server implementation in C using [RFC2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616).

### Warning
- The web server was implemented just for fun in a few hours, not intendeed to be a really efficient web server.
- This implementation has memory leaks and is currently a work in progress.
- The design is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life, whenever I have free time I will apply SOLID and create ADT's.

### Story

This project started as a coding kata for implementing a really simple web server to see
the inner workings of sockets and how the HTTP protocol is implemented.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Add execution permissions to **compile.sh**.
3. Run the script.
4. Enjoy the slow and with leaks web server!

**NOTE**: make sure you have the gcc essential compilation packages installed
